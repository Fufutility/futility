      TL;DR: If it's a term used to refer to people in normal conversation, I'll be fine with it. Otherwise, play it safe and just don't call me... I dunno, whatever you were planning on calling me?
    </p>
    <p>
      I know, I know, you probably don't care much - if at all - so I'll try to keep this short.
      <br>
      I'm fine with any standard pronouns as being, well, my pronouns. "Standard", in this case, is "he/him", "she/her", "they/them", and "it/its".
      <br>
      Additionally, I'll accept "xe/xem" and "ze/zir". "ae/aer", "ey/em", and "fae/faer" are also tolerable.
      <br>
      If it isn't listed explicitly here, just don't use it to refer to me. Please.
      <br>
      Thank you for understanding.
