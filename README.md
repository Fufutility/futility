# Futility
A repository (and, eventually, a website) about me!

At the start, and on the first page, it'll go over
- My basic personality
- What I like to do
- A little news header that I'll change every now and then when stuff happens
- A footer with my contact information (likely just Discord server and username - might add my email though)

I eventually also want to include
- What I can do for other people
- A sort of "wishlist"
- Several article pages

I'm really excited to make this and see how this turns out!!! If you have any tips for how I can improve my code, please don't hesitate to tell me!
