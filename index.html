      ⠀⠀⠀⠀So! This is really my website! I'm honestly a little surprised that I'm finally doing this - I've wanted to for a while, but never really felt good enough with my skills to actually start. I'm really happy that I have, though, because now I can show everyone what I can really do.
      <br>
      ⠀⠀⠀⠀Anyways, sorry about the little rant. It'll probably get removed in a later version of this site, but it's working as placeholder text for now while I find out what to actually include in my site.
      <br>
      ⠀⠀⠀⠀This is super exciting!!!
